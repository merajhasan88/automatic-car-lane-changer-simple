# automatic-car-lane-changer-simple
Programmed in Verilog, this takes in the position and velocity of other cars and then changes lane taking care to avoid any crashes with other vehicles

You can test it yourself: There are three lanes and two cars apart from yours. For horizontal distance any value between 0 and 4 is in left lane, between 4 and 8 is middle and 8 to 12 is right lane.
When the car changes lane it will show you its horizontal location.
